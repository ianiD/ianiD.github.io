				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p>
					I have started programming more or less seriously in third grade when I was 8. The next year (2012) I participated in the informatics olympiad and got to the national phase where I got a silver medal. The next 4 years I continued getting decent results, earning one more silver medal in 2015 and two bronze medals in 2013 and 2016.
				</p>
				<p>
					In mid-to-late 2016 I started attending programming meetups and took part in two hackathons where I helped my team get pretty good results.
