		The site should now look better on mobile devices because I made a few layouts for different width ranges. There is still the problem that resizing the browser needs you to reload if you're on the blog page because the iframes only resize when they load, not also when the window changes size (somewhy it's not that simple as it seems :white_frowning_face:).
