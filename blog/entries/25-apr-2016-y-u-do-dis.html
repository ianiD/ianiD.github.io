						Two days ago I paticipated at the international programming olympiad qualifier contest-thingy
						and I gotta say that I'm pissed. First of all, I was only 2.5 points unter the last guy qualified
						and the qualified guys got some really nice prizes :sad:
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
					  Secondly, I have an LPT for you: Don't round numbers down before getting to the final result... please!
					  The medals are given such that the first half of the contestants get a medal so that there are twice
					  as many silver medals and thrice as many bronze ones as the gold medals. With a little bit of math you get
					  that 1/12 get gold, 1/6 get silver and 1/4 get bronze, right? Not in my case. We were 52, so 1/12 was 4.333...
					  The way I thought of it, the last silver medal would be given to the 13th place (me), because 52*1/12+52*1/6=13,
					  right? Nope. They rounded the 4.33333 down to 4 before calculating anything else and the last silver medal was
					  given to the 12th place. But that's not it, the silver and gold medals also came with a fukkeen hexacopter drone
					  and (I think) a substantial amount of cash.

					  TL;DR - I don' goofd' and could've got a lot of cool stuff if I had practiced more :sad:
