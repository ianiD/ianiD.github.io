				<p>TL;DR - ICs got delivered; RS latch; not enough wires and breadboards</p>
				<p>
					First thing after getting out of school I got a call from the courier telling me
					he had the order. Yay!
				</p>

				</center>
				<p>
					After unpacking everything, I labeled the long IC tubes so that I don't have to
					keep the bag labels or have to read the brown on black serial number on the
					chips themselves. And yes, I know I'm going to have to use pull up and pull down
					resistors everywhere because I'm mixing HC with HCT with LS series. I was dumb
					enough not to research before buying >.<
				</p>
				<p>
					To try these out, I made one of the simplest circuits there are, the RS latch.
					I'm using an Arduino Nano clone as a power source.
				</p>

				</center>
				<p>
					I then realised that my project will become an absolute rat's nest if I
					continued using dupont-like cables instead of cutting fixed length, flush with
					the breadboard ones from a big coil. Too bad I don't have a big wire coil, nor
					capacitors for the 555 clock, nor enough resistors for all the pull-ups, nor
					enough breadboards. This means that the project will be on halt for 2 days
					because it's friday night and all hardware stores near me are closed in the
					weekend.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, not really. I can still plan stuff in these two days.

				<h2>Planning the thing</h2>
				<p>
					<h3>All the mistakes!</h3>
					When I started planning, I realised I forgot to order a ROM chip for the
					instruction decoding. This led me to decide to use punch cards for the program
					memory because punch cards seem really cool. I really hope I won't regret this
					too much. I also forgot to get some demuxes so I'll need to keep decoding binary
					to multiple lines to a minimum. These two are the reason the punch cards will be
					very wide.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>Word length</h3>
					I chose 6 as the word length. I wanted something greater than 4, but 8 seemed a
					little too big. On one hand it would add a few centimeters to the punch card
					width and on the other it would probably require a few more breadboards and
					stupid amounts of transistors for the hopefully few decoders I'll need.
					That won't work for me because I'm really cheap. 7 bits would've probably worked
					but 7 is odd and I have some standards. 6 bit words seem just right. A 6 bit
					charset is big enough to fit letters, digits and a few symbols. 64 instructions
					is not a bad limit at all, really, and the shopping basket won't get bigger than
					what I mentioned at the end of the last section.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>Punch card format</h3>
					I settled on 3 instructions: MOV, SUM and JMP. The 6 PC bits are there to remove
					the need for PC logic.
				</p>
				<center><img src="../assets/img/instructionset.jpg" alt="Instruction set" /></center>
				<p>
					The MOV instruction takes a binary FROM value being the register to read, 6 TO
					bits representing the places the value will be moved to (can be multiple) and 6
					bits that will be the value of the read-only D register for moving literal
					values.
				</p>
				<p>
					The SUM instruction takes a sign bit (addition or subtraction), a CMP bit which
					dictates if the Z and C flags are set, a Carry bit, which if high XORs the carry
					in with the last operation's carry out and a TO part which works like the MOV
					TO.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly, the JMP instruction takes a 3 bit condition and a 6 bit address. This
					sets the controller's "target address" register to that address, making the CPU
					cycle through the punch cards until that PC value comes up.
